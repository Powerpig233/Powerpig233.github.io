TASK: Create a 6x8 matrix of RGB tuples which holds the values for the flag of Hungary.
Requirement: Use list comprehension.
Hint: Partition the problem into three smaller 2x8 matrices, one for each color, and concatenate them in the end.
Additional Information:
a. RGB values vary from 0 to 255. Use simple color combination to create colors
Ex: RED = (255,0,0)
Ex: GREEN = (0,255,0)
Ex: WHITE = (255,255,255)
b. The Hungarian flag is divided into three equal horizontal rectangles, colored red, white and green, from top to bottom.
